# AuthenticationAndAccessRestrictions
Customized version of the AuthenticationAndAccessRestrictions sample from 
http://tools.cherrypy.org/wiki/AuthenticationAndAccessRestrictions.

I've added some Ajax/Javascript/REST calls based on the CherryPy tutorial, and also slightly enhanced some of the 
sample web pages.  Check out my WebAutomationCSharp sample to see how we can use NHTML to automate testing 
of this web UI.
